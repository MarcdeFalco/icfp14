compile with

ocamlbuild simulateur.native

it uses menhir parser generator

then ./simulateur.native <MAP>

it will look at lambdaman.join, gather all source code, compile it, produce a
lambdaman.S assembly, load it into the simulator and run it.
the simulator displays information taylored for this lambdaman: ghost generated
obstacles and distance map, by extracting this information from the first
frame.

The lambdman strategy is a basic greedy one.
